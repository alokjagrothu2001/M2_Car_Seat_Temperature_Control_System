The Seat Heating and Monitoring System is capable of keeping and maintaining car seat to the desired temperature. The button sensor in this project checks if the passenger is sitting in the seat or not, and once seated, the passenger must select the temperature according to his or her needs, after which the seat begins to heat and the corresponding temperature is displayed on the LCD. The operation of the heat or temperature control system has been coded in embedded c and the working is demonstrated using a simuation software called SimulIDE. This system will be done in 3 steps or in 3 activities. When the two switches are closed, the first LED glows indicating the actuation of the system and the heater. Then the analog input from the temperature sensor is received and it digitize that using ADC. The digitized temperature input is visualized using Pulse Width Modulation(PWM).
